WCD audio codec SPI driver support

* wcd_spi

The wcd_spi device is child device node to the master contoller's device node
and will have properties that the SPI framework or the master controller driver
expects. The properties listed here are specific to wcd-spi driver.

Required properties:

- compatible : "qcom,wcd-spi-v2"

- qcom,mem-base-addr : Defines the memory base address from the SPI
		       memory map. This will be used as an offset to read
		       and write memory.

Example:

&spi_10 {
	status = "ok";
	wcd_spi_0: wcd_spi@0 {
		compatible = "qcom,wcd-spi-v2";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <24000000>;
		qcom,mem-base-addr = <0x100000>;
	};
};
